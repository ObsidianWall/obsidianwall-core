# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Welcome to the ObsidianWall FAQ. Here you‚Äôll find answers to the most common questions around using, deploying, and extending the ObsidianWall platform.

---

## üß± General

### What is ObsidianWall?
ObsidianWall is a **Security Infrastructure-as-Code (SIaC)** platform. It provides secure-by-default Terraform modules for multi-cloud deployments, backed by build-time and optional runtime security analysis.

### Who is ObsidianWall for?
It‚Äôs built for DevOps, SecOps, and Cloud Engineers who want composable, production-ready modules without needing to build everything from scratch ‚Äî especially with security and compliance top-of-mind.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Using ObsidianWall

### How do I deploy a module?
Navigate into a module folder and run:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```
**See deploying-modules.md for full guidance.**

### Where can I find module examples?

Inside:
````
ObsidianWall_SIaC/environments/examples/

````
_These provide sample configurations that use one or more ObsidianWall modules._


### Do I need to modify modules?
No. Modules are preconfigured with secure defaults. You can override variables to customize deployments as needed.


### How do I customize a module?

You can customize modules by modifying the `variables.tf` file in the module directory. You can also pass variables directly when running `terraform apply`:

```bash
terraform apply -var="region=us-west-2" -var="instance_type=t3.micro"
```
_You can also create a terraform.tfvars file with your preferred values for reuse._


### Can I use ObsidianWall with other IaC tools?
Yes ‚Äî but with some caveats.

ObsidianWall modules are written in Terraform HCL, so they are natively supported in Terraform workflows.

However, ObsidianWall can be used alongside other IaC tools like:

  - Pulumi (by calling Terraform modules)

  - CloudFormation (in separate stacks)

  - Crossplane (via Composition/ProviderConfig patterns)

_ObsidianWall‚Äôs vision includes future adapter modules and templates to help bridge Terraform and other tools._

### Can I use ObsidianWall with existing Terraform code?
Yes.

ObsidianWall modules are designed to be composable, meaning you can integrate them into your existing Terraform projects seamlessly.

You can:

  - Import ObsidianWall modules into your existing main.tf or stack structure

  - Use terraform_remote_state to link outputs between your current code and ObsidianWall modules

  - Gradually migrate or replace existing modules with more secure ObsidianWall counterparts

_üîê Bonus: By integrating even a single ObsidianWall module, your infrastructure benefits from built-in security validation and Zero Trust defaults._


### Can I use ObsidianWall to deploy non-ObsidianWall IaC infrastructure?
Yes.

You can integrate ObsidianWall modules into broader Terraform stacks alongside community or internal modules. For example:

  - Use ObsidianWall for secure networking or compute

  - Use custom/internal modules for business-specific services

_Just ensure compatibility with Terraform versioning and variable interfaces._

_In the future, obsi-cli and obsidianwall-core may support mixed pipelines, policy validation, and security guardrails across third-party IaC modules as well._

---

## üîê Security & Compliance

### Are the modules secure?
Yes. Every module is scanned with:

  - tfsec (Terraform vulnerability detection)

  - checkov (IaC misconfiguration analysis)

  - tflint (linting and best practices)

_We also validate modules with GitHub Actions CI workflows._

### What is ‚ÄúSecurity-as-Code‚Äù in ObsidianWall?
Security-as-Code means we encode IAM, encryption, network access, logging, and compliance controls directly into our Terraform modules and policies ‚Äî not as afterthoughts.

### Do I need to deploy the NDR modules?
Not required, but recommended. The NDR modules (e.g. ndr-aws-ec2) provide runtime observability and allow advanced threat detection and behavior monitoring. Great for Zero Trust and post-deployment auditing.

---

## ü§ù Contributing

### Can I contribute my own modules?
Absolutely! Start by reading CONTRIBUTING.md in the root repo.

### Are there naming conventions I should follow?
Yes ‚Äî see docs/dev/naming-conventions.md.

### What tools should I install to contribute?
  - Terraform CLI

  - Pre-commit

  - Python (for some scanning tools)

  - Git
_Run pre-commit install after cloning to ensure local checks match CI._  


### Can I use obsi-cli to deploy modules?
_(üß™ Experimental Feature)_

Yes. If you‚Äôre using the obsi-cli tool (ObsidianWall‚Äôs future CLI), you can deploy and manage modules with simplified commands.

Example:
```bash
obsi deploy aws-ec2 --env dev
```
_‚ö†Ô∏è Note: obsi-cli is a planned part of the ObsidianWall ecosystem but may not be available in all releases._


----

## üö® Troubleshooting

### My deployment fails at terraform plan. What now?
Check:

  - Input variables ‚Äî are required values provided?

  - Terraform version ‚Äî ObsidianWall supports 1.6.6+

  - Cloud credentials ‚Äî authenticated to AWS/Azure?

  - Use terraform validate and terraform fmt to check formatting and syntax.

### My module fails CI checks ‚Äî how do I fix it?
Run the same checks locally with pre-commit:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
